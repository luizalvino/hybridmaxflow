PRF contains codes and generators for the maximum flow problem
For more detailed description, see "On Implementing Push-Relabel
Method for the Maximum Flow Problem" by B.V. Cherkassky and 
A.V. Goldberg, IPCO '95, 157--171.

The programs are designed to run under BSD UNIX.
All programs read from the standard input and write to the standard
output. Run "make" to compile the programs and generators.
File "list" lists the programs produced my "make".
Input files are in DIMACS format. See sample.input.

The program takes print level parameter. The default is 1.
Setting print level to two makes the program print the flow found.

PRF was developed by Boris Cherkassky (cher@cher.msk.su) and
Andrew Goldberg (avg@research.nj.nec.com).

The programs are available on "as is" basis. They are not guaranteed to
be free of bugs, and the authors assume no responsibility for any
potential problems.
